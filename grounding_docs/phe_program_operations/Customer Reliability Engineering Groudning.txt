Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) Pilot – Comprehensive Summary
1. Context & Problem Statement
Microsoft Security now supports 1.4–1.5M customers globally, with 900k using four or more security workloads. Despite scale and product breadth (50+ security products across Defender, Sentinel, Entra, Purview, Intune), customer experience is inconsistent due to:

Gaps in product quality
Slow or ineffective support responsiveness
Lack of tenant‑level visibility into customer‑specific outages

Core issue:
Service Reliability Engineering (SRE) monitors platform‑wide health but fails to detect tenant‑specific outages. A large tenant can experience a severe incident while global dashboards remain “green.”
Examples referenced include EY, where high-severity breakdowns (data exfiltration, DLP gaps, unannounced backend changes, payroll impacts) led to executive‑level escalations, degraded confidence, and an escalation rate 3× the S500 average.

2. Why SRE Is Not Enough
SRE detects issues at the service-wide level, not per customer. This creates blind spots:

Minor‑looking degradations at platform level can be critical failures at tenant level.
Only 8% of major outages were auto‑detected by current monitors.
Manually detected issues had 6.7‑day time-to-detect, vs. 2.5 hours for auto‑detect.

Customers continue to report issues before Microsoft detects them — eroding trust and extending downtime.

3. CRE – Proposed Solution
Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) shifts Microsoft from reactive support to proactive tenant‑level reliability assurance. Originating from Google (2016) and later Azure (2018), CRE treats reliability as a shared responsibility with customers.
Primary goal:
Ensure top 50–100 mission‑critical tenants have continuous tenant‑specific monitoring, rapid detection, and automated incident response.
Strategic intent:
“Anticipate, amplify and systemically solve customer needs.”
Expected benefits

Higher customer confidence via fewer fire drills
Operational excellence through faster detection & mitigation
Proactive prevention of customer downtime

CRE is NOT duplicating SRE work — it extends monitoring down to the tenant level.

4. Pilot Scope & Principles
Pilot tenant selection prioritizes:

Mission Critical Services (MCS) customers
Tenants with the highest SEV1/SEV A activity, especially in MDE and Purview

The approach mirrors proven models (e.g., SharePoint Online monitors ~1,000 key tenants for QoS).

5. Proposed Workflow (Steps 1–7)
A clear proactive monitoring & alerting pipeline:
Step 1 — Define Tenant‑Specific Metrics
Co-design SLIs/SLOs with engineering, e.g.:

Identity login success rate
DLP policy creation throttling
Defender client update failures

Step 2 — Telemetry Augmentation
Introduce a “Key Tenants” configuration so core telemetry systems treat these tenants as first‑class objects.
Step 3 — Threshold Breach Detection
Real‑time detection of anomalies tied to tenant health, not global metrics.
Step 4 — Automated Incident Creation
Power Automate / Copilot Agents create Sev‑2.5 ICM tickets automatically when thresholds breach.
Step 5 — CRE Rapid Response
A 24x7 on‑call CRE team responds within <15 minutes, mirroring live‑site operations.
Step 6 — Proactive Customer Engagement
Coordinated notifications to CSAMs + support teams:
“We detected an issue in your environment and are addressing it now.”
Transform outages into trust‑building moments.
Step 7 — Mitigation & Continuous Improvement
Every alert undergoes:

False-positive review
Monitor calibration
Postmortem analysis

Helps reduce noise, improve signal quality, and refine thresholds.

6. Organizational Considerations & Debates
Feedback (captured in comments across the doc) highlights:

Overlap with proposals for an MCS Operations Center
Need to clarify division of responsibilities between Engineering, CxE, and CARE
Concerns about scalability and avoiding duplication of engineering telemetry
A case for starting with workload-first, then expanding by customer
Need for trusted customer communication channels (beyond CSAM de‑relay)


7. Strategic Alignment
CRE aligns to:

Microsoft’s mission to improve product reliability
Azure’s CRE best practices
Existing CxE live-site culture
Customer trust initiatives
Reduced escalation overhead and engineering firefighting


8. Expected Outcomes

Significant reduction in customer‑reported critical incidents
Improved time-to-detect and time-to-mitigate
Better product signals for engineering
Stronger executive trust within top accounts
Lower support cost and critical escalation volume
Accelerated ability to detect real‑world product degradation


9. Next Steps
Within the next quarter:

Align with LT + engineering LTs
Stand up a cross-functional CRE task force
Launch pilot with first 10 tenants
Define tenant metrics per workload
Configure monitoring & alerting
Demonstrate early wins within 3 months
Scale to 50 tenants in one year, backed by measurable reductions in critical incidents


Executive 1‑Page Summary (Copy/Paste‑Ready)
The CRE Pilot introduces tenant‑level monitoring and automated incident response for Microsoft’s top mission‑critical security customers. Today, only ~8% of major outages are auto-detected, and tenant‑specific degradation often goes unnoticed for days. By establishing a Key Tenant framework, defining workload-specific health indicators, and enabling automated Sev‑2.5 incident creation, CRE shifts Microsoft from reactive escalation handling to proactive reliability assurance. A 24x7 CRE on-call team will respond within <15 minutes and partner with CSAMs to deliver trust‑building proactive communications. Within 12 months, the program aims to onboard 50+ tenants, reduce customer-reported incidents, improve TTD/TTM metrics, and deliver significantly better customer outcomes across Purview, MDE, Intune, and Entra.
