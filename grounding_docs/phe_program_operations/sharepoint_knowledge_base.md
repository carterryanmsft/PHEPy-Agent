## Integration with PHEPy Workspace

### Local Files vs SharePoint
- **Local `grounding_docs/`**: Contains exported/cached versions of critical SharePoint content for offline access and faster agent retrieval
- **SharePoint (live)**: Always has the most current information and should be consulted for real-time updates

### Recommended Workflow
1. **For static information**: Use local grounding docs (faster, cached)
2. **For dynamic information**: Reference SharePoint (team changes, active incidents, current priorities)
3. **For verification**: Cross-check local docs against SharePoint if data seems outdated

## Access & Permissions
- **Authentication**: Microsoft corporate credentials required
- **Permissions**: Team members have Read access by default; Contribute access for content owners
- **External Access**: Not available (internal Microsoft only)

## Update Frequency
- **Team roster**: Updated as changes occur
- **Meeting notes**: Weekly (after WSR/MBR meetings)
- **Procedures**: Quarterly or as process changes
- **Customer assignments**: Monthly or as accounts shift

## Related Local Resources

## Agent Usage Guidelines

### For Contacts & Escalation Finder Sub-Agent
- Reference SharePoint team directory for current on-call schedules

## Data Freshness Indicators
When referencing information, note:
- ✅ **Current** (< 7 days): Trust local cached data
- ⚠️ **Aging** (7-30 days): Verify against SharePoint if critical
- 🔄 **Stale** (> 30 days): Always check SharePoint for updates

## Troubleshooting Access Issues
If SharePoint site is inaccessible:
1. Verify corporate network connection (VPN if remote)
2. Check user permissions with team manager
