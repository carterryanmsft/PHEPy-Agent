This resource introduces structured problem solving using the DIVE framework (Define, Investigate, Validate, Execute).

Problem Solving:
A structured approach to closing performance gaps by identifying the gap, addressing root causes, and implementing durable fixes.

Why It Matters:
- Break complex problems into solvable parts.
- Address root causes.
- Reveal cross‑team dependencies.
- Build durable, data‑driven solutions.

When to Use:
- KPIs off track for 2+ months.
- Unclear next steps.
- Recurring issues.

Participants:
- Executive Sponsor
- KPI DRI
- KPI Team Members

Mindset Principles:
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Growth mindset
- Progress over perfection
- Evidence over assumptions
- Intentional problem solving

DIVE Stages:
1. Define — clarify target, actual, gap, trend.
2. Investigate — use evidence, gap concentration, root cause.
3. Validate — countermeasures, experiments.
4. Execute — owners, timelines, controls.

PSR integrates directly with DIVE.
