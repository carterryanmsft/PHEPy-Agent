// KNOWN THEME AREAS FOR eDISCOVERY:
// 1. Content Search (KQL query syntax, scope limitations, indexing delays)
// 2. Legal Hold (placement failures, preservation limits, hold conflicts)
// 3. Export Operations (PST size limits, timeout issues, corrupted exports)
// 4. Review Sets (loading errors, tagging, analytics, OCR processing)
// 5. Permissions & RBAC (eDiscovery Manager role, compliance admin access)
// 6. Performance (large mailbox searches, multi-location queries)
// 7. Teams/Channel Support (private channels, chat vs. channel messages)
// 8. Advanced eDiscovery (ML models, predictive coding, custodian mapping)
